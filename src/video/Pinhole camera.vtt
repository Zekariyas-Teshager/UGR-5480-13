00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.220
Have you ever seen light rays coming
through the holes of a damaged roof?

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.980
You'll be surprised to know,

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.540
as you can see,
that the light rays from such holes

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.740
produce images of the sun
when they fall on the ground.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.940
Why?

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.060
Because these irregular shaped holes
in the roof act as pinhole cameras.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.100
Now, what are pinhole cameras?

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.040
Let's first come construct one pinhole

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.500
camera and then let's try
to understand the principle.

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.900
Now, by definition,
a pinhole camera is a simple optical

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.420
device that forms an image
without using a lens or a mirror.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.220
That's surprising.

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.100
Now let's join two hollow cylindrical
boxes of different diameters

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.620
in such a way that one box can
just slide within the other.

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.940
Now what do we do?

16
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.340
We make a small hole in the larger

17
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.740
cylinder there and also make two
holes in the smaller cylinder.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.050
The one inside fine,
but there is one care you need to take.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.570
The inner hole has to be rectangular
and the outer hole has to be circular.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
We now fix a translucent paper,
say a tracing paper,

21
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
on the rectangular hole,
because that's going to act as a screen.

22
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.440
Now, very importantly,
these two cylinders must be enclosed so

23
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.850
that you can prevent light
from entering the larger cylinder.

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.820
That will mess up our image.

25
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.930
Now use this pinhole camera
and try looking at the tree.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.380
Surprise.

27
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.660
A clear image of this tree can be obtained

28
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.290
on the screen if you slide
the smaller cylinder back and forth.

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.020
Now, how exactly did it happen?

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.700
Let's look at this diagram.

31
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.060
The tree is, say M-N-M is the topmost
point, n is the bottom most point.

32
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.660
The light rays coming from the bottom
of the tree, that is N.

33
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.780
They pass through the small hole and flag
the screen at the top of the axis n dash.

34
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.300
Can you see that?

35
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.380
And the light rays coming from the top

36
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.580
of the tree, that is M, strike at the
bottom of the axis, that is M dash.

37
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.860
Now, what happens as a result,
as you can see, and inverted,

38
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.780
and also a much smaller image of the tree,
is what you get on the tracing paper.

39
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.220
Remember the tracing paper
which acted as a screen.

40
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.820
Now, the size and contrast of this image,
it can be adjusted for that.

41
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.500
All you need to do is slide
the smaller cylinder.

42
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.100
Also, one more thing.

43
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.860
The image depends
on the size of the pinhole.

44
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.700
The smaller the pinhole,

45
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.760
the sharper will be the image ma'am,
and of course, vice versa.
